 >## 🏹 Aim
 >
 Danny,an excellent pizza maker, aimed to establish his own pizza empire during quarantine but he knew he can't setup a physical business, So he decided to *uber* his pizzas and so Pizza Runner was launched!
 He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.
 
  The dataset contains six tables:
   - runner_orders
   - runners
   - customer_orders
   - pizza_name
   - pizza_recipes
   - pizza_toppings
