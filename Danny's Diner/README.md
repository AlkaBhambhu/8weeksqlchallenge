  Danny opened a small Janpanese restaurant that sells three of his favourite dishes: Sushi, Ramen & Curry. Danny wants to take advantage of the data to review few patterns like best seller item, repeat customers, new customers, amount of money spent by each customer etc to have a better and more personalised relationship with his customers. Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:
 - sales
 - menu
 - members
